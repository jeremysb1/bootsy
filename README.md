# bootsy

The purpose of this project was to get more familiar with Bootstrap. 

Bootstrap is an open-source framework enabling developers to quickly standup websites. 

It uses a grid system, a series of containers, rows, and columns, to layout and align content. Itâ€™s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. 

The framework offers many components such as buttons, navigation bars, forms, modals, JavaScript plugins built on jquery, etc., where developers can quickly copy and paste the code for any component they would like to use on their website.

Also offered is a lightweight CDN delivering the components quickly and securely. This improves website performance by reducing latency and improving response times so users can view content quicker. 

More information can be found in the documentation.
